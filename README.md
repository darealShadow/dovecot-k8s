# dovecot-k8s
This repo contains the documentation for my dovecot implementation in Kubernetes which I walk through in detail on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@Iloveopensourcesoftware.

When deploying this stateful set to your cluster, you must make sure to have all config maps aligned and deployed. As I am not using all the config maps in my deployment you might have to review and update these configuration maps and modify the stateful set accordingly.
